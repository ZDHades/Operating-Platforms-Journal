# Summary
This document is a software design template for a CS 230 project. The document includes an Executive Summary, Requirements, Design Constraints, System Architecture View, Domain Model, Evaluation, and Recommendations. The document also includes a Document Revision History.

The document explains the design constraints that come with web applications, and how the application will be accessed on a variety of screen sizes, browsers, and devices. It provides a domain model for the main processes of the application and the classes that will be used. The document also evaluates the development requirements for different operating systems and development tools and makes recommendations based on the characteristics and techniques specific to various systems architectures.

## Client and Software Requirements
The client for this project is Draw it or Lose it, an android application. The software requirement is to have it exist as a web application so that it can be accessed across a number of clients. This process will require a rebuild of the application and its fringe in its new environment which will come with significant development costs.

## What was done particularly well in developing this documentation?
The document is well-structured and easy to follow. It provides clear and concise information about the project requirements and design constraints. The document also evaluates the development requirements for different operating systems and development tools and makes recommendations based on the characteristics and techniques specific to various systems architectures.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of working through a design document helps in identifying the key requirements and constraints of the project. It provides a clear understanding of the scope of the project and helps in identifying potential challenges and risks. This, in turn, helps in developing an effective strategy for developing the code.

## What would you revise if you could choose one part of your work on these documents?
If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would revise the evaluation section to provide more specific information about the advantages and disadvantages of each operating system and development tool. This would provide a more detailed analysis of the development requirements and help in making more informed recommendations.

## How were the user’s needs interpreted and implemented into the software design?
The user's needs were interpreted by understanding the client's requirements and constraints. The design of the software was based on the need to have it exist as a web application so that it can be accessed across a number of clients. The domain model was designed to provide a clear understanding of the main processes of the application and the classes that will be used.

## Why is it important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it helps in developing software that is relevant and useful to the end-users. Understanding the user's needs and requirements helps in designing software that is user-friendly, easy to use, and provides the required functionality.

## How was the approach to designing software?
The approach to designing software was based on understanding the client's requirements and constraints. The design of the software was based on the need to have it exist as a web application so that it can be accessed across a number of clients. The domain model was designed to provide a clear understanding of the main processes of the application and the classes that will be used. The evaluation section provided an analysis of the development requirements for different operating systems and development tools, and recommendations were made based on the characteristics and techniques specific to various systems architectures.
